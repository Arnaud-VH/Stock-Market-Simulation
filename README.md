# About this repository:
This repository contains the project me and my partner (clemjvdm) made for the Advanced Objected Oriented Programming Course given at the University of Groningen in 2023.

This project was split into three parts, which all build ontop of eachother. The first part focused on building a basic message queue. More specifically a Data Utility Queue (DUQ). The assignment description of this part of the project can be found in the **1_duq.md** file. The second part concerned adding networking functionalities to the message queue, focusing on good design and the decoupling, reusability, and maintainability of the individual components. The description of this assignment can be found in the **2_networking.md** file. Lastly, the third part of the project was to put all the pieces together and create the Stock Market simulation. A list of requirements for the third part is stated in the **3_stonks.md** file, where the assignment description for this part can also be found. 

A lot of effort went into making this project, which was accurately reflected in the high final grade of 9.3/10 as an average across the three parts.

Within the **stocks** directory there is another **README.MD** that acts as the report for this project.
